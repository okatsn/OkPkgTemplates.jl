`OkPkgTemplates` initiate julia package with CI presets that automate test, release tag, documentation and registry management **based on** [okatsn/OkRegistry](https://github.com/okatsn/OkRegistry) with my personal preferences.

Please read `README.md` of the generated package for further instructions to complete the workflow setting.


## Compatibility
`OkPkgTemplates` is compatible to `PkgTemplates` of this commit: https://github.com/JuliaCI/PkgTemplates.jl/commit/0de5d855e050d93169f8661a13b3a53a8cb2b283 or [v0.7.29](https://github.com/JuliaCI/PkgTemplates.jl/releases/tag/v0.7.29)


## TODO: TagBot Error
### Known issue
Seemingly, TagBot is designed to be interrupted in the process of scanning sequentially the existent tags until `Error: TagBot experienced an unexpected internal failure`.
However, in many of my packages it experience this error at a much earlier stage that no further version can be tagged anymore, this is not what I desired.

The detail of the internal failure above is like:
```
raise self.__createException(status, responseHeaders, output)
github.GithubException.GithubException: 403 {"message": "Resource not accessible by integration", "documentation_url": "https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/git#create-a-reference"}
```

Excluded possible causes for this error:
- The `${{ github.event.head_commit.message }}` in the changelog template: I delete them in `Shorthands` and `OkPkgTemplates`'s `Tagbot.yml`. But the problem remains.
- The broken of `OkRegistry`: Seemingly no problem in `OkRegistry`. It is OK to make your registry as a Package (as [HolyLabRegistry](https://github.com/HolyLab/HolyLabRegistry)). Furthermore, for example, in `OkPkgTemplates` there is no inconsistency of version numbering, problem still occurred.

It seems to be an issue of permissions that may occur in many cases, see the threads:

## TODO: Hints for Documenter

In `docs/make.jl`, add pages for example:
```julia
pages=[
    "Home" => "index.md",
    "Examples" => "examples/examples.md",
    "Exported Functions" => "functions.md",
    "Models" =>
                ["Model 1" => "models/model1.md",
                 "Model 2" => "models/model2.md"],
    "Reference" => "reference.md",
    ]
```

In which,
- the `index.md` is the home page, where
    - [`@index` block](https://documenter.juliadocs.org/stable/man/syntax/#@index-block) makes a list of links to docstrings once generated by `@autodoc` in any of your `.md` files for pages.
    - [`@autodocs` block](https://documenter.juliadocs.org/stable/man/syntax/#@autodocs-block) automatically generates docstrings given
        1. the `Modules` (e.g., `Modules = [Foo, Bar, Bar.Baz]`)
        2. the `Pages` (e.g., `Pages   = ["a.jl", "b.jl"]`)
- [`@contents` block](https://documenter.juliadocs.org/stable/man/syntax/#@contents-block) generates table of contents.
    - Example
      ```@contents
      Pages = ["examples/examples.md"]
      Depth = 5
      ```

!!! note
    - If error occurred in generating the page, try the followings in your local machine:
    ```julia
    makedocs(root=joinpath(dirname(pathof(OkPkgTemplates)), "..", "docs"), sitename="TEMP")
    ```
    - Use `dirname(pathof(OkPkgTemplates))` to locate `OkPkgTemplates/src`!

!!! warning for  `@autodocs`:
    Noted that you cannot generate duplicate doc strings with `@autodocs`, with later ones all ignored with warning messages. For example:
    In `index.md`, I have `@autodocs` block:
    ```@autodocs
    Modules = [SWCForecast]
    Order   = [:function, :type]
    ```
    , which generates docstrings for ALL instances under `SWCForecast`.
    After that, in `"models/model2.md"`, I have `@autodocs` block:
    ```@autodocs
    Modules = [SWCForecast]
    Order   = [:function, :type]
    using FileTools, SWCForecast
    Pages = filelist(r".+\.jl", joinpath(dirname(pathof(SWCForecast)),"mymodels"); join=false)
    # which might be `Pages = [model2.jl, model2a.jl]` in the directory "mymodels", for example
    ```
    , which is intended to generate docstrings for instances (functions, macros, structs...) defined in all `.jl` files in the directory "mymodels".
    However, since the docstrings for an instance cannot be `@autodocs` twice, the corresponding `@autodocs` block in the page `"Model 2" => "models/model2.md"` will be empty.
